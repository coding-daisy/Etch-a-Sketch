# Etch-a-Sketch

Welcome to my interactive sketching tool, built as part of the curriculum of The Odin Project!

## How It Works
This sketch tool lets you customize the grid layout by setting the number of rows and columns. The grid automatically clears when the layout changes.
You can pick a color from the color palette, and painting is as simple as holding Shift while hovering over the grid.
Canâ€™t wait to see what you create!

## Purpose
This project was created to apply the JavaScript basics learned during the **Foundations** course, including:
- Arrays & loops
- Functions & conditional logic
- Flexbox-based layout
- Event handling and listeners
- DOM manipulation methods
